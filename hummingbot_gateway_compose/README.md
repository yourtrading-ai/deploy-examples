# Deploy Hummingbot and Gateway Instances

This installs a [Hummingbot](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot) instance linked to a [Hummingbot Gateway](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway) instance.

## Prerequisites

This configuration requires [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The recommended way to get Docker Compose is to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), which includes Docker Compose along with Docker Engine and Docker CLI which are Compose prerequisites.

See [Docker](../DOCKER.md) for more information about how to install and use Docker Compose, as well as helpful commands.

## Getting Started

Installing Hummingbot alongside Gateway lets you access data and execute orders on DEX connectors.

To enable this, you will do need a few things first:
- Install and configure the Hummingbot and Gateway instances
- Generate self-signed certificates in Hummingbot
- Give Gateway the passphrase used to generate the certificates (`GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE`)

Verify that Docker Compose is installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
docker compose version
```

The output should be: `Docker Compose version v2.17.2` or similar. Ensure that you are using Docker Compose V2, as V1 is deprecated.

### 1. Launch network

Clone this repo to your machine and go to the folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourtrading-ai/deploy-examples.git
cd deploy-examples/hummingbot_gateway_compose
git checkout feat/mango-markets-2
```

Alternatively, copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to a directory on your machine where you want to store your Hummingbot files. 

This is the "root folder" where your encrypted keys, scripts, trades, configs, logs, and other files related to your bots will be saved.

From the root folder, run the following command to pull the image and start the instance:
```
docker compose up -d
```

After the images have been downloaded, you should see the following output:
```
[+] Running 3/3
 ⠿ Network hummingbot_gateway_compose_default     Created
 ⠿ Container hummingbot                           Started
 ⠿ Container gateway                              Started       
```

### 2. Set permissions

Run this command from your root folder to grant read/write permission to the `hummingbot_files` and `gateway_files` sub-folders:
```
sudo chmod -R a+rw ./hummingbot_files ./gateway_files
```

You may run into read-only permission issues if you don't do this.

### 3. Add scripts

Populate Hummingbot scripts folder with example scripts from the Hummingbot image:
```
docker cp hummingbot:/home/hummingbot/scripts-copy/. ./hummingbot_files/scripts/
```

This step is needed to being able to run the script examples. You can also copy individual [script examples](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/tree/master/scripts) into the `hummingbot_files/scripts` folder to make them available to your instance.


### 4. Launch Hummingbot and generate certificates

Now, attach to the `hummingbot` instance:
```
docker attach hummingbot
```

You should see the Hummingbot welcome screen:

![welcome screen](../welcome.png)

Set your Hummingbot [password](https://docs.hummingbot.org/operation/password/) and write it down. This is the `CONFIG_PASSWORD` environment variable in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

Run the following command to generate Gateway certificates:
```
gateway generate-certs
```
![generate certs](./generate-certs.png)

You'll be prompted for a passphrase used to generate the certificates. This is the `GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE` environment variable in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

Hummingbot will use the passphrase to generate the certificates and save them in the `hummingbot_files/certs` folder, which is mapped to the `/home/hummingbot/certs` in the image. This location is also mapped to `/home/gateway/certs`, where the Gateway instance will look for the certificates it needs.

Afterwards, run `exit` to exit Hummingbot.

### 5. Remove network

Once you're back in Bash/Terminal, run the following command to remove the Compose project:
```
docker compose down
```

You should see the following output:
```
[+] Running 3/3 
 ⠿ Container gateway                            Removed
 ⠿ Container hummingbot                         Removed
 ⠿ Network hummingbot_gateway_compose_default   Removed
```  

### 6. Modify YAML file

Now, use an IDE like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Edit the section that defines the `CONFIG_PASSWORD` and `CONFIG_FILE_NAME` environment variables:
```yaml
  hummingbot:
    # environment:
      #  - CONFIG_PASSWORD=[password]
  gateway:
    # environment:
      #  - GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE=[passphrase]
```

Uncomment out:
 * The `environment:` lines
 * The `CONFIG_PASSWORD` lines: add your Hummingbot password
 * The `GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE` line: add the passphrase you used to generate the certificates

The final `environment` section of the YAML file should look like this:
```yaml
  hummingbot:
    environment:
      - CONFIG_PASSWORD=[password]
  gateway:
    environment:
      - GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE=[passphrase]
```

Afterwards, save the file.

### 7. Recreate network

Now, recreate the Compose project:
```
docker compose up -d
```

Attach to the `hummingbot` instance. If you have defined `CONFIG_PASSWORD` in the YAML file, you don't need to enter it again:
```
docker attach hummingbot
```
After you enter your password, you should now see `GATEWAY:ONLINE` in the upper-right hand corner.

Open a new Terminal/Bash window. In it, attach to the `gateway` instance to see its logs:
```
docker attach gateway
```
See [Gateway](https://docs.hummingbot.org/gateway/) for more details on how to configure it for use with Hummingbot.

## Updating to the Latest Version of Hummingbot

Hummingbot and Hummingbot Gateway are updated on a monthly basis, with each new version marked by a code release on Github and DockerHub, accompanied by the publication of comprehensive release notes. To upgrade to the most recent version, you just need to pull the `latest` Docker images.

Follow the steps below to upgrade your Hummingbot system:

1. **Ensure no containers are running**

   Before you initiate the update process, it is crucial to verify that no Docker containers are currently running. Use the following command to shut down any active containers:

   ```
   docker compose down
   ```

2. **Fetch the latest Docker Hummingbot image**

   Once you have confirmed that no containers are running, proceed to pull the latest Hummingbot Docker image. Use the following command to accomplish this:

   ```
   docker pull hummingbot/hummingbot
   ```
3. **Fetch the latest Docker Gateway image**

   Next, we'll need to also pull the latest Docker Gateway image

   ```
   docker pull hummingbot/gateway
   ```

4. **Start the updated containers**

   Having pulled the latest Docker image, you can now start up your containers. They will be running the latest version of Hummingbot. Use the following command to start the containers:

   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

With these steps, you will have successfully updated your Hummingbot + Gateway to the latest version.
